# How to compile:

1) Have mongodb running (either manually or as a background process).

&emsp; In a console window:

2) cd to the "Server" directory.

3) Run "npm install" to install the dependicies needed for the server.

4) Run "npm run seed". This will populate the mongo server with seed data.

5) Run "npm start" to start the backend server on port 4000. 

&emsp; In a seperate console window:

6) cd to the "Client" directory.

7) Run "npm install" to install the dependicies needed for the client.

8) Run "npm start" to start the frontend client on port 3000. 

**It is crucial to run both the server and the client at the same time for the site to function properly!**
